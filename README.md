# Hotel-Recommendation-System
Creating a hotel recommendation system site involves multiple steps, from data collection and preprocessing to building the recommendation model, and finally, developing the website. Here's a high-level outline of the steps involved:
1. Data CollectionCollect data about hotels, including features like location, price, amenities, user reviews, ratings, etc. You can source this data from online datasets, hotel APIs, or web scraping.
2. Data PreprocessingClean and preprocess the data to make it suitable for analysis and modeling. This step involves handling missing values, normalizing data, and possibly encoding categorical variables.
3.Building the Recommendation ModelUse a machine learning algorithm to build the recommendation model. Popular algorithms for recommendation systems include Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering, and Hybrid Models. For simplicity, let's use a Collaborative Filtering approach with the surprise library in Python.
4.Developing the WebsiteDevelop a web application using Flask (for the backend) and HTML/CSS/JavaScript (for the frontend).
